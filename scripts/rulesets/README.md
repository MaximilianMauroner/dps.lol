# Offline retained-source tools

Use a trusted, stable local snapshot and a `PinnedSourceSet` manifest. These tools
do not fetch sources, publish catalogs, or establish whether declared hotfix and
region mappings are historically correct. Concurrent hostile replacement of
parent directories is outside the filesystem adapter's confinement guarantee.

Verify every declared artifact's retained bytes and source-set identity:

```sh
bun scripts/rulesets/verify-retained.ts source-set.json retained-directory
```

Discover champion/item index IDs from selected artifact IDs in that manifest:

```sh
bun scripts/rulesets/discover-retained.ts source-set.json retained-directory champion-index item-index
```

The second command verifies the entire declared source set before discovering
selected indices from the same in-memory bytes. It prints canonical JSON with
source-set identity, artifact identities, source pointers, all index records,
empty-name gaps, and `undiscoveredArtifactIds`. Selection order does not change
output. Unknown, duplicate, empty or unsupported selections fail. Any verification
or discovery error produces a nonzero exit and no partial report on stdout.

Discovery preserves unnamed, nonpurchasable and inactive-map item records.
Neither a successful report nor an empty undiscovered list proves a complete
ruleset inventory, legality, implemented mechanics or combat-complete coverage.
The report only covers the explicitly declared and selected sources.

Compile the selected pinned Data Dragon champion index, `championFull` detail,
and item index into one partial source catalog:

```sh
bun scripts/rulesets/compile-retained-ddragon.ts source-set.json retained-directory champion-index champion-detail item-index
```

Every declared retained file is verified before output, including unselected
artifacts. The catalog includes numeric champion/item IDs, source pointers,
passive and four primary spell slots, empty-name gaps, selected artifact paths
and hashes, undiscovered artifact IDs, and a deterministic catalog hash. Changed
source bytes or source-set hotfix identity change that hash. The output is
explicitly `data-dragon-index-and-primary-slots-only` and `combatComplete:false`;
it does not supply alternate forms, mechanics, mode legality, regional hotfix
evidence, or a complete P02 inventory. Errors leave stdout empty.

Inventory one retained CommunityDragon character `.bin.json` source:

```sh
bun scripts/rulesets/discover-retained-cdragon.ts source-set.json retained-directory cdragon-character-id
```

The command verifies every source-set file, then records every typed top-level
record path and its JSON pointer. It checks the character record's explicit
`mAbilities` links and each ability's `mRootSpell`/`mChildSpells` references
against the same retained bytes. Missing or conflicting referenced paths fail.
The report includes the CommunityDragon revision, URL, byte hash, retained
path, undiscovered artifact IDs and canonical report hash. It labels PC patch
mapping as unreviewed and combat completeness as false; extracted record links
alone do not determine spell behavior, forms, active game modes, or regional
hotfix application.

Match a retained CommunityDragon character directory listing to a retained Data
Dragon champion index:

```sh
bun scripts/rulesets/compile-retained-cdragon-roster.ts source-set.json retained-directory champion-index-id character-directory-id
```

The command verifies every declared source file before parsing the two selected
artifacts. It requires every Data Dragon champion slug to have one exact directory
link and reports every other directory as unclassified. A directory link is only
a source path in the retained listing: it does not prove a `.bin.json` file exists, identify
alternate forms or mode assets, or establish a PC patch/CommunityDragon revision
mapping. This is an inventory of links in retained HTML source bytes; it does not
execute page scripts or certify the browser-rendered page. Missing, duplicate or
conflicting links fail without partial stdout.

CLI limits are 1 MiB for the manifest, 16 MiB per artifact and 64 MiB total retained
bytes. Programmatic callers can supply artifact/total limits. No decompression or
production database/bucket writes occur.

# Source mapping verification

`bun scripts/rulesets/verify-source-mapping.ts <source-set.json> <retained-directory> <source-mapping.json>`
checks every declared retained file before validating the source mapping. The mapping binds one
PC patch, Data Dragon version, CommunityDragon revision, regional hotfix assignments, and explicit
mode/map/queue assignments to the verified source-set hash. Each region and mode names retained
artifact IDs as evidence. The command prints a compact hash and count report only after all checks
pass; it does not fetch, archive, publish, or certify complete mode or mechanic coverage.

Create a mapping through `buildSourceMapping` after `assertPinnedSourceSet`, then retain both
manifests and the raw artifact bytes. Reverify through `assertSourceMapping` or this command before
using an assignment. The current 26.18/16.18.1 source inventory has no accepted CommunityDragon
and mode/hotfix evidence bundle, so no real mapping manifest is published here.
